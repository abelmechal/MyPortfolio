    personalStory: [
    `I was born in Ethiopia, and like many kids with African parents, I grew up thinking I’d become an engineer, a pilot, or a businessman. That all started to shift when I moved abroad for university and took my first programming class—it completely changed my perspective.`,

    `The first flight of my life was the day I came to the United States, which is still the only country I've visited so far. One day, I hope to explore Europe. But for now, my journey has been in code. Programming became a daily routine, and over time, I realized I wanted to become a software engineer.`,

    `Since then, I’ve been committed to learning, building, and growing as an engineer. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen trying new recipes or relaxing with a good movie.`
